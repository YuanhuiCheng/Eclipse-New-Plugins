# Eclipse_Plugins

The repository is created to combine the two other repositories in my Github called [Eclipse_Plugin_NewEditor](https://github.com/YuanhuiCheng/Eclipse_Plugin_NewEditor) and [Eclipse_Plugin_NewWizard](https://github.com/YuanhuiCheng/Eclipse_Plugin_NewWizard) for conveniently reviewing. 
## Eclipse Plugin NewEditor
A design of multiple Eclipse Plugin extensions including **editor page**, **outline page**, **search page**, **hyperlink detector**,
**double link strategy** and etc.

The way to implement the customized searching function in Eclipse refers the branch function implemented in [TypeScript](https://github.com/palantir/eclipse-typescript/tree/master/com.palantir.typescript/src/com/palantir/typescript/search).
## Eclipse Plugin NewWizard
A design of new wizards and new wizard pages for Eclipse Plugin extensions.  
- The project provides the methods of using SWT to customize your own wizard pages used for Eclipse Plugin by specific 
purposes or UI needed.
